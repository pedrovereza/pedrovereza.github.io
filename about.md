## About me

Hi, my name is Pedro Vereza, I was born in Blumenau - SC and 17 years later I got into programming. I currently study Computer Science at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, live in Porto Alegre and work with brilliant people at [**Thought**Works][tw].

Despite the different languages I use to develop software, I like to focus on the study of concepts that do not depend on specific tools. In the end, tools come and go, but the concepts remain.

## About this blog

In general, everything on this blog will be related to computing: from math related posts to Agile Software Development.

I like to be pragmatic, but I also think it's important to be aware of theory behind things. Don't be surprised if some pure theoretic article show up once in a while.

PS: Everything on this blog reflects my own opinion. Nothing should be considered as **Thought**Works' or any other author's opinion, except when explicitly expressed.
