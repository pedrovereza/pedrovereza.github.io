title: "Developers don't know how to teach"
---

Everybody worked, at least once, at some place where some developers seemed not to care about the code they wrote. Commented blocks of code, bad formatted code, variables *x, c, d*, classes and methods with thousands of lines are typical signatures of programmers that can't program.

For a long time, together with colleagues, I made hard critics to the work of said developers. The code is bad and the person doesn't do anything to get better. But is this the reality?

I recall when I first started to code: everything was so magical and it seemed like I had found a new world full of opportunities - and I really had. I learned OO, I learned C#, I learned a lot of things. But concepts related to clean code, TDD/BDD, SOLID, DDD were only presented to me **two years later**. I worked around 8 hours a day and, for two long years, **I wrote mediocre and bad code**. Many times without even realising it, since that was the standard around me.

What I was lacking, and many people don't recognise the importance of it, was exposure. How could I study that concepts if I had never been exposed to it? Knowing that there is something called TDD is different than pairing with an experienced developer to code something using TDD.

And that's where problems show up: most of experienced developers just criticise and, in the best cases, refactor the code written by someone else. None of these attitudes teaches anything. Redoing the work of others doesn't help anyone, a better alternative is trying to spread the knowledge to team members. Being a cowboy developer that solves everything alone is the best way to keep being a cowboy developer.

Try to lend your Clean Code book, share the blogs you read, organize dojos, look for better pair programming techniques for your team and environment. With the right approach, every programmer learns to program.
